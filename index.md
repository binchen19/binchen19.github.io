{: #about}
Hi! I am an Assistant Professor at the [Journalism and Media Studies Centre](https://jmsc.hku.hk/), [Faculty of Social Science](https://www.socsc.hku.hk/fw/), [the University of Hong Kong](https://hku.hk/). My research interests include digital media and politics, computational social science, social and political implications of emerging technologies, and comparative media studies. Before joining HKU, I received my Ph.D. in [Journalism and Media](https://journalism.utexas.edu/) and M.S. in [Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.utexas.edu/) from [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/).

My research is primarily driven by quantitative and computational methods. My current research projects are categorized into three primary areas:

- **Cross-Platform Information Flow and Influence**: In this strand, I focus on the dynamics of information within the hybrid media system—including news media and social media. I explore how information flows from one platform to another and the strategic use of various digital platforms by activists, politicians, and media organizations.
- **Computational Social Science**: My research is often driven by cutting-edge computational tools, including multimodal data analysis (image-as-data, radio-as-data). I am also working on inferential network analysis to explore dynamics in organizational behaviors, such as OSINT collaboration, mobilization, and information governance networks.
- **Artificial Intelligence in Journalism and Media Studies**: I investigate the social and political implications of recent generative AI in journalism and media studies. I am particularly interested in how different generative AI technologies play distinct roles and their effects on users' perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors.

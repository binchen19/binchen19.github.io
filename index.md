## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Journalism and Media at the University of Texas at Austin. My supervisor is [Dr. Stephen Reese](https://journalism.utexas.edu/faculty/stephen-d-reese) and I am a GRA for [Dr. Josephine Lukito](https://moody.utexas.edu/faculty/jo-lukito). As of now, I serve as a Graduate Research Fellow at the [Center for Media Engagement](https://mediaengagement.org) (CME) and the student lead for the Data and Democracy (D&D) research group. I also hold an M.S. degree in Statistics and Data Science from the University of Texas at Austin.

My research interests center on using quantitative, computational, and mixed-methods approaches to study political issues. My ongoing research is focused on multi-platform spread of mis/disinformation and their interplay with news media and platforms. I am also interested in comparative media studies and how different media ecologies may shape news production and public opinion.

## Research Interests

- **Computational Social Science:** large-scale text processing, content analysis, network analysis, frame detection, text classification
- **Political Communication:** political mis/disinformation, digital collective actions, strategic communication
